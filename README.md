## Overview

The Raiden Network uses a federation of [Matrix](https://matrix.org) servers as
its transport layer and a set of services for improved usability. This set of
services is called the Raiden Service Bundle. To ensure reliability,
availability and neutrality it is desirable that those services are being
operated by multiple independent entities.

Therefore we provide this repository which allows easy setup of such a service
bundle. It uses docker and docker-compose for easy installation and upgrades.

Currently only this single-server configuration is supported; in the future we
may also provide configurations with services split among multiple servers.

### Used software

- docker
- docker-compose
- Synapse
- Postgres
- Traefik
- Raiden Services (Pathfinding, Monitoring)

```


We use Traefik as a reverse proxy and also utilize its capability of
automatically provisioning Let's Encrypt TLS certificates.

The Synapse server is being run in the so-called split worker configuration
which increases throughput.

The database stores the message data. Since the transport layer is considered
ephemeral in Raiden it is not necessary to arrange for backups of the database
data.

### Network

After a successful deployment the following ports will be in use:

- 80 - HTTP
  - Redirects to HTTPS
  - Let's Encrypt HTTP challenge for certificate provisioning
- 443 - HTTPS
  - Synapse web and API client access
  - Synapse Server-to-Server federation
  - Raiden Pathfinding Server (on subdomain `pfs.$SERVER_NAME`)
  - Metrics export (IP restricted, see below)

## Requirements

### Hardware

Minimum recommended for a production setup:

- 16 GiB RAM
-  8 Cores
- 50 GiB SSD

Note: The default Postgres configuration assumes 16GiB of system RAM

### Software

- Docker >= 17.12
- docker-compose >= 1.21.0

### Other

- A domain (or subdomain) for exclusive use by this server
- No other software should be used in production on this server 

## Installation

### Preparation

1. Provision a server that meets the [hardware](#hardware) and [software](#software) requirements listed above.
1. Ensure a domain (or subdomain) is available

   Examples:
   - raiden.somedomain.com

1. Configure `A` (and optionally `AAAA`) DNS records for the domain pointing to the servers IP address(es)
1. Configure a `CNAME` DNS record for `*.<domain>` pointing back to `<domain>`




### Installing the RSB <a name="installation/installing" />

1. Clone the [current release version of this repository](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-service-bundle/tree/2020.03.0rc1)
   to a suitable location on the server:

   ```shell
   git clone -b 2020.03.0rc1 https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-service-bundle.git
   ```
1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and modify the values to fit your setup (see inline comments for details)
   - We would appreciate it if you allow us access to the monitoring interfaces
     (to do that uncomment the default values of the `CIDR_ALLOW_METRICS` and `CIDR_ALLOW_PROXY` settings).
   - We also recommend that you provide your own monitoring. The setup of which is currently out of scope of this document.
   - Please, read carefully the disclaimers for the path finding and monitoring service and uncomment the variables `XX_ACCEPT_DISCLAIMER` if you agree. Note, that the services won't start if you do not.
1. If you haven't done so before, run `./register-service-provider.sh` (it uses configuration values from `.env`). Please read the information provided [Registering as a RSB Provider](#installation/registering) carefully before executing the script.
1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services
   - The services are configured to automatically restart in case of a crash or reboot

---
**NOTE**

Being accepted in the whitelist as a part of the federation currently takes up to 24 hours after your server name has been added to `known_servers.main.yaml`. After running `docker-compose up -d` you will likely encounter errors but you don't need to worry about them as they will resolve over time. The RSB is configured to restart upon failure automatically. Please verify that your RSB is connected and running successfully after a period of 24 hours.

### Registering as a RSB Provider <a name="installation/registering" />
If you want to participate in the network by running a Raiden Service Bundle you need to register yourself as a provider. Currently, there are two conditions that must be fulfilled to run the RSB successfully.

1. **Registering in the Services Registry On-Chain**  
  - In order to register as a service provider you need to run the script [`register-service-provider.sh`](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-service-bundle/blob/master/register-service-provider.sh).
  - Make sure that the account is stored in `${DATA_DIR}/keystore/`. If not, the script will exit with an error and you cannot register as a service provider.
  - Make sure, that the account, configured in `KEYSTORE_FILE`, has enough funding to register as a service provider. Click [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x735722704e365c37247bb3e4ec52d6c937c54539#readContract) (Currently deployed on goerli) to find out what the current price for a slot is. You will find the price under `3. currentPrice` denominated in SVT. Otherwise, the script will tell you the price, too.


2. **Extending `known_servers.main.yaml`**  
  - In order to be whitelisted in the Matrix Federation, the list needs to be extended with your server name.
  - [Create an issue](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-service-bundle/issues/new) and submit the
   domain / URL of the newly deployed server for inclusion in the list of known servers. Please, state your server name as you have set `$SERVER_NAME` in your `.env` file.

### Verifying that the RSB is working

- Matrix

- PFS

- MS


### Troubleshooting the RSB installation
After starting, you can run `docker-compose ps` -- if any services are not in `Up`, `Up (healthy)` or `Exit 0` state, you should check the respective logs for configuration errors.
Note: some services might need a few minutes to become healthy.



## Upgrades

To upgrade to a new release please check the [changelog](#changelog) for any
necessary configuration changes and then run the following commands:

```shell
git fetch origin --tags
git reset --hard <new-release-tag>
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```
## Notes:

 - A 'purge' script/service will run once a day, pruning old state from rooms to save disk space,
   and restarting the ``synapse`` service to fetch an up-to-date whitelist of servers.

## Known issues

### Protection against Spam / (D)DoS attacks

There is currently only some protection against Spam and / or DDoS attacks.
This will be addressed in future updates.

### Known servers

The known servers the Raiden clients try to connect to are currently tracked in
the *.yml files in this repository. These lists are used by Raiden clients when
the ``--matrix-server=auto`` (default) option is used, for automatically
selecting a transport server, based on response times. We intend to change this
in the future to use a decentralized scheme (for example an on-chain registry).
